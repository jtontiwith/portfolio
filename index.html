        <h1>Hi, I’m Jon. I’m a Full Stack JavaScript Developer and I like building tools.</h1>
        <p>I am JS developer and I like building tools that help users make plans, concept ideas, participate in markets, etc. The world is forum for action, and I like building the digital tools that help users focus their actions for better results. When I’m not in a code editor I can be found planting vegetables, hiking in the woods, and musing about whether the latest technology tools are any better than pen and paper.</p>
